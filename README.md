# Fake-News-Detection

## Made a Fake News Detection Using NLP Natural Language Processing with my classmate 
### Used Nltk Library for building the model, trainned the model over 15k plus record and got an accurracy of around 86%
### STEPS INVOVED
### Preprossesing the data 
##### removed all th stop words the article's from the dataset
##### Removed the outliers from the data accordingly to the trend

##### Techniques's Used
##### We used different techniques starting from Naive aprroach using Countvectorizer to do the convert the data into machine readble form
##### starting from there used HashVectorizer and then moving toward TFID 
##### Using Multinomial Classifier at first
